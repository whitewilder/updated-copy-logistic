### Corporate vs. Non-Corporate Scope: Simplified Guide

#### **Included in Corporate Scope:**
1. **For-Profit Enterprises**:
   - Companies that primarily produce goods or provide services (non-financial sectors).
   - Excludes specialized lending like project finance.

2. **Commercially Operating Non-Profits**:
   - Non-profit organizations that operate like businesses and produce financial statements (e.g., universities, NHS Trusts).

3. **Pure Financial Services Providers**:
   - Entities related to financial institutions that provide services rather than holding or dealing in financial assets (e.g., fund managers, insurance brokers).

4. **Conglomerates & Investment Holding Companies**:
   - If more than 50% of their revenue comes from non-financial activities and they provide consolidated financial accounts.

#### **Excluded from Corporate Scope:**
1. **Entities Without Eligible Financial Accounts**:
   - Examples include Sovereign Wealth Funds and consultancy partnerships.

2. **Specialized Lending**:
   - Entities classified under IRB regulation (e.g., project finance) are excluded.

3. **Financial Sponsor-Led Transactions**:
   - Financial sponsor-led buyouts or refinances in the UK.

4. **Public Sector Entities**:
   - Sovereigns, local governments, and supranational entities are excluded (but public sector-owned non-financial corporates are included).

5. **Banks & Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs)**:
   - Entities primarily holding or trading financial assets.
   - A specific model for NBFCs is under development but not yet included.

6. **Individuals/HNWI/Private Banking**:
   - Entities that operate as individuals without corporate-style accounts, including High Net Worth Individuals (HNWI) and private banking clients.

### **Key Considerations:**
- **Turnover Thresholds**: Parent or standalone entities with turnover above specific thresholds (>$700m or >$550m) are included.
- **Regulatory Permissions**: Some entities may require regulatory waivers to be included, depending on the region.
- **Model Scope**: Some financial institutions, particularly those not classified as "pure" financial services, are excluded from the general corporate model and may require a specialized approach.

This guide helps clarify what is considered within the corporate scope and what is not, ensuring businesses understand their classification and the appropriate models or considerations that apply to them.


### Understanding Corporate and Non-Corporate Scope

When determining whether an entity falls within the corporate scope, several key factors are considered. **Corporate entities** typically include for-profit enterprises that primarily produce goods or provide services in non-financial sectors. These businesses are considered corporate if they do not engage in specialized lending, such as project finance, and meet certain financial thresholds. Commercially operating non-profits, like universities or NHS Trusts, that generate financial accounts and operate similarly to businesses, are also included. Entities related to financial institutions, such as fund managers or insurance brokers, that provide services rather than hold or trade financial assets, fall under the corporate scope as well. Additionally, conglomerates and investment holding companies are included if more than 50% of their revenue is generated from non-financial activities and they disclose consolidated financial accounts.

On the other hand, **non-corporate entities** are those that do not meet the criteria for inclusion in the corporate scope. This includes entities that do not produce eligible financial accounts, such as Sovereign Wealth Funds or consultancy partnerships. Specialized lending entities, like those classified under IRB regulation, and financial sponsor-led transactions, such as buyouts or refinances, are excluded from the corporate scope. Public sector entities, including sovereigns, local governments, and supranational organizations, are also excluded, though public sector-owned non-financial corporates are included. Furthermore, banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) that primarily hold or trade financial assets are not considered corporate and require a specialized approach. Lastly, individuals, including High Net Worth Individuals (HNWIs) and private banking clients, who operate without corporate-style accounts, are also classified as non-corporate.

By understanding these distinctions, businesses can better identify whether they fall within the corporate scope or if they require a different approach.
