In the meeting, there was a discussion about scoping subsidiaries, with Andrew noting that the decision could be based on subsidiary characteristics or the parent organization, depending on organizational needs. He emphasized that there isn't a single solution, as there are multiple options, each with pros and cons. Anita added that they need to evaluate all three options to fully understand the impact. David clarified that non-financial entities like insurance brokers and exchanges do not require separate models, while financial leasing companies are outside the scope. The conversation also highlighted the historical dataset from 2008 to 2023, indicating that while scoping may change, the long average default rates and credit risk levels in historical data are expected to remain consistent.
