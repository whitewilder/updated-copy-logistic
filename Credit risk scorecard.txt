The discussion focused on the long-term average default rates for the parent segment, represented by the red dotted line on the left-hand graph, indicating a rate of 70 basis points. The blue line reflects the average probability of default (PD) across various historical models, including overrides. The gap between these two lines represents the margin of conservatism embedded in the current modeling process, which appears comfortable. However, the conservatism is primarily observed in lower-rated entities with fewer exposures. The regulator expects a consistent margin of conservatism across all grades. While the left side of the graph shows a conservative outlook, the right side reveals less effective conservatism, particularly among sub-investment-grade ratings. This highlights an ongoing issue in the bankâ€™s models, where there is a tendency to overstate the ability to discriminate risk, resulting in PD estimates for sub-investment grades being too low compared to actual risk. This misalignment has contributed to significant increases in bank PD headsets.
